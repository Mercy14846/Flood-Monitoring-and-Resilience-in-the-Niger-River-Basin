# Near-Time GIS for Flood Monitoring and Analysis in Niger River Basin, Nigeria
This repository hosts the resources, code, and documentation for the study **"Enhancing Disaster Response and Resilience Through Near-Time GIS for Flood Monitoring and Analysis in Niger River Basin, Nigeria"**, as presented at the ISPRS TC III Mid-term Symposium, 2024.

### Overview
Flooding in Nigeria is a critical issue affecting lives, livelihoods, and infrastructure, particularly in the Niger River Basin. This project leverages Google Earth Engine (GEE) for near-real-time flood mapping, impact analysis, and flood resilience modeling. It combines multi-temporal remote sensing datasets with geospatial analysis techniques to quantify flood hazards, assess exposure, and provide actionable insights for disaster response.

### Key Features
- **Automated Flood Monitoring**: Utilizes Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 datasets for accurate and timely flood mapping.
- **Impact Assessment**: Integrates population, land use, and building footprint data to quantify flood impacts.
- **Scalable Workflow**: Cloud-based processing using GEE for efficient and reproducible geospatial analytics.
## Methodology
### Data Sources
- **Sentinel-2 MSI**: Optical imagery for flood detection and land-use classification.
- **Sentinel-1 SAR**: Radar imagery for cloud-penetrating flood analysis.
- **NASA SRTM DEM**: Elevation data for terrain analysis.
- **Global Surface Water Dataset**: Historical water body dynamics.
- **Landsat 8**: Additional multi-temporal land cover analysis.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Google Earth Engine**: Primary platform for data processing and analysis.
- **ArcGIS Pro**: For additional preprocessing and visualization.
- **Python**: Supporting scripts for modeling and data manipulation.
### Workflow
1. **Data Acquisition**: Collect and preprocess satellite imagery and terrain datasets.
2. **Flood Mapping**: Apply spectral indices (e.g., NDWI) and radar analysis to delineate flood extents.
3. **Impact Analysis**:
    - Assess changes in land use and land cover.
    - Overlay flood extents with population and building datasets.
4. **Visualization**: Generate maps and reports using geospatial tools.

## Results
- **Flood Extent Analysis**: A 53% increase in inundation area was observed during the 2022 flood peak.

- **Land Use Impacts**:
    - Loss of agricultural land and vegetation due to prolonged waterlogging.
    - Conversion of 15,000 hectares to unproductive wetlands.

- **Population and Infrastructure**:
    - Over 150,000 residents were affected by flooding.
    - 143,000 buildings identified within flood-prone zones.
